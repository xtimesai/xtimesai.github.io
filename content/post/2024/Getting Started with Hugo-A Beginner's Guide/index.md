Getting Started with Hugo: A Beginner's Guide

## Prerequisites

Before starting with Hugo, make sure you have:

- A GitHub account
- Basic knowledge of command prompt/terminal
- A text editor (like VS Code)

## Installation Guide (Windows)

1. **Download Hugo**
   - Go to Hugo's official documentation
   - Navigate to the Windows installation section
   - Download the latest prebuilt binaries for your system

2. **Set Up Hugo**
   - Create a folder named `hugo` on your system
   - Inside it, create another folder named `bin`
   - Extract the downloaded files into the `bin` folder
   - You should see three files in the `bin` folder

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Copy the full path to your Hugo `bin` folder
   - Add this path to your system's Environment Variables
   - To verify installation, open command prompt and type:

     ```bash
     hugo version
     ```

## Creating Your First Hugo Site

1. **Initialize a New Site**

   ```bash
   hugo new site project-name
   ```

   This will create a new Hugo site with the default directory structure.

2. **Add a Theme**
   - Hugo requires a theme to generate static pages
   - You can browse themes at Hugo's theme repository
   - Install a theme using Git submodule:

   ```bash
   git init
   git submodule add [theme-repository-url] themes/[theme-name]
   ```

3. **Configure Your Theme**
   - Open `config.toml` in your site's root directory
   - Add the theme setting:

   ```toml
   theme = "theme-name"
   ```

## Creating Content

1. **Create Your First Post**

   ```bash
   hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
   ```

   This creates a new post in the `content/posts` directory.

2. **Edit Your Post**
   - Navigate to `content/posts/my-first-post.md`
   - The file will have front matter at the top:

   ```markdown
   ---
   title: "My First Post"
   date: 2024-11-12
   draft: true
   ---
   ```

   - Add your content below the front matter
   - Set `draft: false` when you're ready to publish

3. **Preview Your Site**

   ```bash
   hugo server
   ```

   This starts a local server, typically at `http://localhost:1313`

## Tips for Success

- Always check theme documentation for specific configuration options
- Keep your Hugo installation updated
- Use version control (Git) to track changes
- Test your site locally before deploying

## Next Steps

- Explore Hugo's content management features
- Customize your theme
- Learn about Hugo's template system
- Set up continuous deployment

Remember: Hugo is powerful and flexible - start simple and gradually explore more advanced features as you become comfortable with the basics.
