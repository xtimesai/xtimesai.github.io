# Beginner's Guide to Using a Hugo Theme

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have:
1. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) installed on your system
2. A code editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
3. Basic familiarity with command line operations

## Step 1: Theme Installation

1. Download the theme from the source
2. Unzip the downloaded file
3. Navigate to the theme folder:
```bash
cd lightbi-hugo-master
```

## Step 2: Project Structure
The theme folder should contain these essential directories:
- `archetypes/` - Contains default content templates
- `content/` - Where your website content goes
- `layouts/` - Contains theme templates
- `static/` - For static files (images, CSS, JavaScript)
- `config.toml` - Main configuration file

## Step 3: Building Your Site

1. To build your site, run:
```bash
hugo
```
This command:
- Creates a `public/` directory
- Generates static files from your content
- Applies the theme styling

2. To preview your site locally:
```bash
hugo server
```
This command:
- Starts a development server
- Makes your site available at `http://localhost:1313`
- Enables live reload for real-time changes

## Step 4: Adding Content

1. Create new content using:
```bash
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```

2. Edit the generated markdown file in the `content/posts` directory

## Step 5: Customization

1. Configure your site by editing `config.toml`:
```toml
baseURL = "https://example.org/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "My New Hugo Site"
theme = "lightbi-hugo"
```

2. Customize theme parameters according to the theme documentation

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. If the server doesn't start:
   - Check if port 1313 is already in use
   - Try using a different port:
     ```bash
     hugo server -p 1314
     ```

2. If theme isn't applying:
   - Verify theme name in `config.toml`
   - Ensure theme files are in the correct directory

## Deployment Tips

1. Always run `hugo` command before deploying
2. Use the contents of `public/` folder for deployment
3. Consider using GitHub Pages or Netlify for hosting

## Best Practices

1. Keep content organized in appropriate directories
2. Use meaningful names for content files
3. Regularly commit changes if using version control
4. Test locally before deploying

## Next Steps

1. Explore theme-specific features
2. Learn about Hugo shortcodes
3. Customize templates
4. Add custom CSS/JavaScript

Remember to check the theme's documentation for specific features and customization options available with this particular theme.
