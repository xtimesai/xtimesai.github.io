To ensure the archetypes/bundle-post/index.md file exists, follow these steps to create and verify it:

1. Navigate to Your Hugo Project Directory
In the terminal, make sure you’re in your Hugo project’s root directory:

cd /Users/minijohn/AI_Project/aixdaily.github.io
2. Create the Bundle Archetype Directory and File
Check if the archetypes folder exists in your project. If it doesn’t, create it:
mkdir -p archetypes/bundle-post
Now create the index.md file inside the bundle-post folder:
touch archetypes/bundle-post/index.md
3. Add Basic Front Matter to index.md
Open the file in a text editor and add the following front matter template:

---
title: "{{ replace .Name "-" " " | title }}"
date: {{ .Date }}
draft: true
resources:
  - name: "featured-image"
    src: "featured.jpg"
---
This front matter will initialize new posts with a title, date, and placeholder for an image resource.

4. Verify the File Exists
You can confirm the file exists by listing the contents of the archetypes/bundle-post directory:
ls archetypes/bundle-post
You should see index.md listed.
Once the archetypes/bundle-post/index.md file is set up, you can run:

hugo new --kind bundle-post content/en/post/2024/my-new-post
This should now create a page bundle with index.md under content/en/post/2024/my-new-post.
