# A Beginner's Guide to Markdown Syntax

## Table of Contents
1. [Headings](#headings)
2. [Paragraphs](#paragraphs)
3. [Text Styling](#text-styling)
4. [Images](#images)
5. [Examples](#examples)

## Headings

Headings are created using the hash symbol (#). The number of hashes determines the heading level:

```markdown
# Heading 1 (Largest)
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6 (Smallest)
```

**Important Tips:**
- Always put a space after the hash symbols
- Use heading levels in order (don't skip from H1 to H4)
- Only use one H1 per document

## Paragraphs

Creating paragraphs in Markdown is simple. Just separate your text with a blank line:

```markdown
This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph.

This is the third paragraph.
```

**Best Practice:** Don't indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs.

## Text Styling

### Bold Text
There are two ways to make text bold:

```markdown
**Using asterisks**
__Using underscores__

This word is **partially** bold
```

### Italic Text
Similarly, there are two ways to italicize text:

```markdown
*Using single asterisks*
_Using single underscores_

This word is *partially* italicized
```

### Combining Bold and Italic
You can combine both styles:

```markdown
***Bold and italic***
**_Bold and italic_**
```

## Images

Images follow this syntax:
```markdown
![Alt text](URL "Optional title")
```

Example:
```markdown
![Cute cat](https://example.com/cat.jpg "My cat")
```

Breaking down the parts:
- `!` - Tells Markdown this is an image
- `[Alt text]` - Description of the image (shown if image fails to load)
- `(URL)` - The image's web address or file path
- `"Optional title"` - Text shown when hovering over the image

## Examples

Here's everything put together:

```markdown
# My Travel Blog

## Trip to Paris

Last weekend, I visited **Paris** for the first time. The *Eiffel Tower* was ***amazing***!

![Eiffel Tower](https://example.com/eiffel.jpg "Paris at sunset")

### Places I Visited
- Notre-Dame Cathedral
- The Louvre
- Arc de Triomphe

I can't wait to visit again!
```

**Pro Tips:**
1. Be consistent with your styling choices (stick to either asterisks or underscores)
2. Use headings to create a clear document structure
3. Always include descriptive alt text for images
4. Leave blank lines before and after headings for better readability
5. Don't overuse formatting - if everything is bold, nothing stands out!
